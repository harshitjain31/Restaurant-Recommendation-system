# Restaurant Recommendation System

## Overview

This project is a recommendation system designed to suggest the top 10 restaurants with reviews similar to a particular restaurant. It leverages Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to transform textual reviews into feature vectors, which are then used to measure similarity between restaurants using cosine similarity.

## Features

- **Textual Review Processing**: Transforms restaurant reviews into feature vectors using NLP.
- **Similarity Measurement**: Uses cosine similarity to find and recommend restaurants with similar reviews.
- **Top Recommendations**: Provides a list of the top 10 restaurants with the closest review similarity to a given restaurant.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: Core programming language for the project.
- **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**: For transforming textual reviews into feature vectors.
- **Cosine Similarity**: For measuring the similarity between feature vectors.
- **Libraries**:
  - `numpy`: For numerical operations.
  - `pandas`: For data manipulation and analysis.
  - `seaborn`: For data visualization.
  - `matplotlib`: For plotting graphs.
  - `sklearn`: For machine learning algorithms and data preprocessing.
  - `nltk`: For natural language processing tasks.
